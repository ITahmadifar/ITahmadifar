#  👋 Hi, I am Ahmad Ahmadifar 
I did my bachelor's at [K. N. Toosi University of Technology](https://en.kntu.ac.ir/ "K. N. Toosi University of Technology"). After my bachelor's, I pursued further IT and Data Science knowledge to combine my engineering expertise with new fields, fostering innovation and expanding my knowledge. My interest in data science led me to participate in relevant courses, including Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Statistical Analysis. I am passionate about applying engineering and data science principles to solve real-world challenges.
##  👀 I am interested in
**Data Science:** I am fascinated by the power of data to uncover insights and drive informed decision-making. I am particularly interested in applying data science techniques to real-world problems, such as predicting trends, optimizing processes, and developing innovative solutions.

**Machine Learning:** I am passionate about developing intelligent algorithms that can learn from data and make accurate predictions. I am excited about the possibilities of machine learning in fields like finance, healthcare, and autonomous systems.

**Statistical Analysis:** I believe that a strong foundation in statistics is essential for data-driven decision-making. I am interested in using statistical methods to analyze data, test hypotheses, and quantify uncertainty.
##  🌱 I am currently learning
**Programming languages:** Like Python, R, and MATLAB, to implement data science and machine learning algorithms.

**Advanced data science techniques:** Such as deep learning, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.
##  💞️ I am looking to collaborate on
**Research projects:** These involve developing novel data science and computer vision algorithms and applying them to real-world problems.

**Industry projects:** That leverage data science and machine learning to solve business challenges and improve operational efficiency.

**Open-source projects:** That contribute to the data science community and foster collaboration among researchers and practitioners.
## 🚀 Entry to GitHub
During my years of experience, the organizations I worked with employed their own local Git version control systems to manage codebases effectively. However, I didn't create a personal GitHub account until now. I'm enthusiastic about joining the GitHub community, where I hope to collaborate on projects, contribute to open-source efforts, and further develop my skills while interacting with developers from around the world.
